What you are testing: Create a brand new event from the admin panel, then complete a booking for that event, and finally verify the seat count drops by exactly 1.

Setup
- BASE_URL = https://eventhub.rahulshettyacademy.com
- Credentials: < Create your own credentials>
- Write a reusable login(page) helper function — you will call it at the start of the test

Steps
Step 1 — Login
- Navigate to /login
- Fill email field (locate by placeholder you@email.com)
- Fill password field (locate by label Password)
- Click the login button (locate by id #login-btn)
- Assert: link with text Browse Events → is visible (confirms login success)

Step 2 — Create a new event
- Navigate to /admin/events
- Generate a unique event title using Test Event ${Date.now()} — store this in a variable, you will need it throughout the test
- Fill Title field (locate by id #event-title-input)
- Fill Description textarea (locate using #admin-event-form textarea)
- Fill City field (locate by label City)
- Fill Venue field (locate by label Venue)
- Fill Event Date & Time field (locate by label Event Date & Time) — use your futureDateValue() helper
- Fill Price ($) field (locate by label Price ($)) — use any number e.g. 100
- Fill Total Seats field (locate by label Total Seats) — use 50
- Click the submit button (locate by id #add-event-btn)
- Assert: toast message Event created! is visible

Step 3 — Find the event card and capture seats
- Navigate to /events
- Get all event cards (locate by data-testid="event-card")
- Assert the first card is visible (confirms page loaded)
- From all cards, filter for the one that contains your event title text
- Assert the matched card is visible (timeout 5 seconds)
- Read the seat count text from that card (locate element containing text seat, parse integer from its inner text) — store this as seatsBeforeBooking

Step 4 — Start booking
- On the matched event card, click the Book Now button (locate by data-testid="book-now-btn" inside the card)

Step 5 — Fill booking form
- Assert: element with id #ticket-count has text 1 (default quantity)
- Fill Full Name (locate by label Full Name)
- Fill Email (locate by id #customer-email)
- Fill Phone (locate by placeholder +91 98765 43210)
- Click the confirm button (locate by CSS class .confirm-booking-btn)

Step 6 — Verify booking confirmation
- Locate the booking reference element (locate by CSS class .booking-ref, take .first())
- Assert it is visible
- Read its inner text, trim it — store as bookingRef

Step 7 — Verify in My Bookings
- Click the link View My Bookings
- Assert: URL is BASE_URL/bookings
- Get all booking cards (locate by id #booking-card)
- Assert the first booking card is visible
- Filter booking cards for the one that contains an element with class .booking-ref matching your bookingRef text
- Assert that matched card is visible
- Assert that matched card contains your eventTitle text

Step 8 — Verify seat reduction
- Assert the first event card is visible
- Filter cards again using hasText: eventTitle
- Assert the card is visible
- Read the seat count text again (same as Step 3) — store as seatsAfterBooking
- Assert: seatsAfterBooking === seatsBeforeBooking - 1
